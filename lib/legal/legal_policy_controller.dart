  final String cancelSimpleIntro = '''
At AmbuFast, we understand that emergency situations can change rapidly, and patients or their guardians may sometimes need to cancel a booked ambulance. To balance user flexibility with fairness to ambulance providers, we have implemented the following cancellation policy for customers. This section outlines the rules, eligibility for refunds, fees involved, and actions taken in cases of repeated cancellations.
''';

  final String cancelWhenTitle = '‚úÖ When You Can Cancel';
  final String cancelWhenBody = '''
As a customer, you are allowed to cancel a trip directly from the app interface any time before the ambulance reaches your pickup location. The cancel button will be visible in your booking details page while the trip is still in the ‚ÄúConfirmed‚Äù or ‚ÄúOn the Way‚Äù status. Once the driver has arrived or marked the trip as ‚ÄúStarted,‚Äù cancellation is no longer allowed through the app.
''';

  final String cancelGraceTitle = '‚è±Ô∏è Grace Period for Free Cancellation';
  final String cancelGraceBody = '''
To ensure a fair experience for everyone, AmbuFast provides a 2-minute grace period immediately after confirming your booking. If you cancel your trip within this 2-minute window, you are eligible for a full refund of the advance payment, with no penalty or deduction. This gives you time to change your mind or correct accidental bookings without any financial impact.
''';

  final String cancelAfterTwoTitle = '‚ö†Ô∏è Cancellations After 2 Minutes';
  final String cancelAfterTwoBody = '''
If you cancel your trip after 2 minutes, a cancellation fee will apply. This fee is deducted from your advance payment and typically ranges between ‡ß≥100 to ‡ß≥300, depending on the ambulance type and zone. The fee helps compensate the driver for time lost, fuel costs, and the blocked slot which could have served another emergency patient.
''';

  final List<String> cancelFeeExamples = const [
    'Basic Ambulance: ‡ß≥100 cancellation fee',
    'AC Ambulance: ‡ß≥150',
    'ICU or Freezing Ambulance: ‡ß≥200‚Äì‡ß≥300',
  ];

  final String cancelFeeNote =
      'The exact fee will be shown to you before you confirm cancellation, ensuring full transparency.';

  final String cancelNoTitle = '‚ùå No Cancellation After Arrival or Trip Start';
  final String cancelNoBody = '''
If the ambulance has already arrived at your location or the driver has marked the trip as ‚ÄúStarted,‚Äù cancellation is no longer allowed. In such cases, no refund will be issued, and the full advance amount is considered forfeited. This policy prevents abuse and ensures that ambulance resources are not wasted or blocked unnecessarily.
''';

  final String cancelRepeatTitle = 'üîÅ Repeated or Abusive Cancellations';
  final String cancelRepeatBody = '''
AmbuFast monitors cancellation patterns to prevent misuse. If a user is found to cancel trips frequently, especially after the grace period or without valid reasons, the following actions may be taken:
''';
